          with one or more orders, and are issued a transferable NFT token. The
          NFT serves as the credentials for interacting with the underlying
          position. For more information on Carbon, please visit{' '}

          Carbon is deployed on public blockchains to provide a variety of
          functions as described more fully in the FAQ, and governed through a

          BancorDAO may determine to update or deploy additional smart contracts
          in order to, among other things, add new features or functionalities,
          or respond to events such as chain migrations, security incidents,
          vulnerabilities, “forks” or other changes to the underlying
          blockchain.

          Because Carbon is deployed on public blockchain networks, it is
          directly accessible through command lines, command prompts or through
          other decentralized applications (dApps) or third party interfaces.

          does not need the Carbon SDK in order to interact with Carbon. It is

          transactions to interact with Carbon.

          legal consequences. Users are solely liable for any action performed

          the User’s sole responsibility to verify the performance of any
          transaction contemplated or consummated through the Site or the

          prior to utilizing the Site or the Content:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Risks of Cryptographic Systems and Currencies. By using the Site or
          the Content in any way, you acknowledge the inherent risks associated
          with cryptographic systems and ecosystems; and represent and warrant
          that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native
          cryptographic tokens. You understand that blockchain technologies
          (such as Ethereum) and associated currencies or tokens are highly
          volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption,
          speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that
          the cost of transacting on such technologies (where applicable) is
          variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities
          taking place on the relevant blockchain (such as Ethereum). You
          acknowledge these risks and represent, warrant and agree that the
          Foundation cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased
          costs. The Foundation shall not be held liable for any losses or
          damages resulting from the use of the Site, the Content or the
          services of any third-party provider (including through any Third
          Party Integrated Application).

          Technological Knowledge Required. Understanding Tokens requires
          advanced technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in
          exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive
          understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to
          appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on the Site does not
          indicate the Foundation’s approval or disapproval of the underlying
          technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute
          for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. In
          using the Site and the Content, you represent that you have been, are,
          and will be solely responsible for making your own independent
          appraisal and investigations into the risks relating to and concerning
          the Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market
          sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own
          evaluation of the merits and risks of any conversion or any underlying
          Token.

          Token Deployment and Conversion Risks. You represent and warrant you
          accept the risk of deploying orders and/or strategies that involve
          converting Tokens. You represent and warrant you understand that
          Carbon may use untested code and protocols. You accept the risk of
          loss of assets deployed using Carbon, conversion failure or fault. You
          agree not to hold the Foundation accountable for any related losses.
          Neither you nor we, can reverse, change or cancel a conversion of
          Tokens transaction marked as complete or pending. Conversion of Tokens
          using the Site and the Content is managed and confirmed via the
          relevant blockchain. You represent and warrant you understand that
          your relevant blockchain public address will be made publicly visible
          whenever you use the Site or the Content.

        <br />
        <p>
          Compliance with Laws. You represent and warrant you are responsible
          for complying with applicable law. You agree that the Foundation is
          not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to
          your conversions, including with respect to tax or money transferring
          regulations. You agree you are solely responsible for reporting and
          paying any taxes arising from your use of the Content.

          Operational Challenges. You represent and warrant that you are aware
          of and accept the risk of the Site’s and the Content’s operational
          challenges. The Site and the Content may experience sophisticated
          cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or
          technical difficulties, which may hinder the use of the Site or the
          Content or affect or even cause faults or failures in the conversion
          of Tokens, or in the information displayed. You agree not to hold the
          Foundation accountable for any related losses. We also do not own or
          control the underlying software protocols, which govern the operation
          of the Tokens supported on our platform. You acknowledge and agree
          that the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in
          operating rules such as “forks”, and that such forks may materially
          affect the value, function, and even the name of the Tokens you store.
          In the event of a fork, you agree that we may suspend the Site or the
          Content (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may decide
          whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the
          forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume
          absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported
          branch of a forked protocol; and that we are not responsible for
          operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of
          their functionality, security, or availability.

          No Advice. The Foundation does not advise on converting risk. If at
          any point the Foundation or its representatives do provide converting
          recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act
          of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no
          obligation of truth or due diligence on behalf of the Foundation or
          its representatives.
