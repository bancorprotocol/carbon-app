        <p>
          We process personal data for the purposes described in the Information
          Collection and Purposes for Collection section of this Privacy Policy.
          We will store your personal information as described in the Retention

          us to do so, and/or for at least one of the following legal reasons:

          the processing of your personal data as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          You have the right to information about your personal data processed
          by us and to the following information: (a) the processing purposes;
          (b) the categories of personal data being processed; (c) the
          recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have
          been or are being disclosed, in particular recipients in third
          countries or international organizations; (d) if possible, the planned
          duration for which the personal data will be stored or, if this is not
          possible, the criteria for determining this duration; (e) the
          existence of a right to rectification or deletion of your personal
          data, to restricting the processing of your personal data or to
          objecting to such processing; (f) the existence of a right of appeal
          to a supervisory authority; (g) if the personal data is not collected
          from you, all available information about the origin of the data; (h)
          the existence of automated decision-making and, at least in these
          cases, meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and
          intended impact of such processing on the data subject; and (i) in the
          case of the transfer of personal data to a third country or an
          international organization, on the appropriate safeguards in relation
          to the transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to immediately request the rectification of
          inaccurate personal data concerning you and, taking into account the
          purposes of the processing, the completion of incomplete personal
          data, by means of providing a supplementary statement.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to request the immediate erasure of personal data
          concerning you and we are obliged to delete this data immediately if
          one of the following reasons applies: (i) the personal data is no
          longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or
          otherwise processed; (ii) you revoke your consent on which the
          processing was based under Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the
          GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing; (iii) you
          object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and
          there are no overriding legitimate grounds for processing or you
          object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR; (iv)
          your personal data has been processed unlawfully; (v) the deletion of
          your personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation under UK
          law, EU law or the law of the EU member states to which we are
          subject; (vi) the personal data have been collected in relation to
          information society services provided in accordance with Article 8(1)
          of the GDPR. If we have made personal data public and are obliged to
          erase personal data in accordance with Article 17(1) of the GDPR, we
          will take appropriate measures, including technical measures, taking
          into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to
          inform controllers who process the personal data you have requested
          the erasure by such controllers of any links to or copies or
          replications of, such personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rights in the foregoing paragraph do not apply to the extent that
          processing is necessary (A) to exercise the right of freedom of
          expression and information; (B) to fulfill a legal obligation required
          for processing under UK law, EU law or the law of the EU member states
          to which we are subject; or (C) to assert, exercise or defend legal
          claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to request that we restrict processing if one of
          the following conditions is met: (1) the accuracy of the personal data
          is contested by you, for a period of time that enables us to verify
          the accuracy of the personal data; (2) the processing is unlawful and
          you oppose the deletion of the personal data and instead request the
          restriction of the use of your personal data; (3) we no longer need
          your personal data for the purposes of processing, but you do need it
          to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; or (4) you have objected
          to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the
          verification of whether the legitimate interests of our company
          override your legitimate interests.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that
          you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and
          machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit this data
          to another controller without hindrance, provided that the processing
          is based on a consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a)
          of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR
          and the processing is carried out by automated means. When exercising
          your right to data portability, you have the right to have your
          personal data transferred directly by us to another controller, to the
          extent that such transfer is technically feasible.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from
          your particular situation, to the processing of personal data
          concerning you which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR,
          including profiling based on these provisions. We will no longer
          process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling
          legitimate reasons for the processing that override your interests,
          rights and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise or
          defend legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the right to revoke your consent to the processing of your
          personal data at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect

          until revocation.

          For us to process a request to know, access, correct, or delete, it is
          necessary for us to verify your identity. We will ask you to provide
          certain additional information about yourself, such as name, physical
          address, email address and phone number, or other identifying
          information, to compare to information we have on file for you to
          verify your identity. We cannot fulfil your request if we cannot
          verify your identity. It may take up to forty-five (45) days to fulfil
          your request. If we cannot complete your request within the initial
          forty-five (45) day period, we will notify you in writing within
          forty-five (45) days of your initial request.

          authorized this person to act for you and to verify your identity as
          provided above.

          appeal, we will inform you of any action taken or not taken in
          response to your appeal, along with a written explanation for these
