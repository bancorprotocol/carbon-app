# CarbonDeFi webapp

Carbon DeFi is an advanced onchain trading protocol enabling automated limit orders, efficiently adjustable with custom price ranges, grid trading like recurring orders, working like a DEX trading bot.

# Setup

## Requirements

To run the app locally, you need the following:

- Node.js 20+
- Yarn

For E2E testing you need a Tenderly account and an API Key.

## Run locally

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

2. In the project directory, you can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the app in development mode by running the following:

```bash
yarn start
```

You can choose the network to run the app by setting the `VITE_NETWORK` variable in the `.env` file. The default network is `ethereum`.

Alternatively, if defined in the in the [package.json](package.json) file, you can select the network to use by running `yarn:network` where `network` is one of the networks defined in the [config](src/config/index.ts) and the `yarn:network` command is defined in [package.json](package.json) file as follows:

```bash
"start:network": "cross-env VITE_NETWORK=network vite",
```

Example:

```bash
"start:ethereum": "cross-env VITE_NETWORK=ethereum vite",
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the development mode app in the browser.

### Docker Usage

We use Docker to streamline the testing and deployment process, specifically for E2E tests. Docker ensures a consistent environment across different machines, allowing tests to run reliably.

#### Pre-Built Docker Image

We have a pre-built Docker image that includes all necessary dependencies for running Playwright tests and ImageMagick for image comparison:

- **Docker Image**: `doronbancor/playwright-imagemagick:latest`

This image is hosted on Docker Hub and can be used in your CI/CD pipelines.

#### Building the Docker Image Locally

If you need to make changes to the Docker image or update dependencies, you can build it locally using the provided `Dockerfile`.

##### Steps to Build the Docker Image

1. **Install Docker**

   If you don't have Docker installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask docker
   ```

   Start Docker Desktop and ensure it is running on your system.

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Navigate to the project directory where the `Dockerfile` is located and run the following command to build the image:

   ```bash
   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t yourusername/playwright-imagemagick:latest .
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with your Docker Hub username.

3. **Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**

   Log in to Docker Hub and push the image:

   ```bash
   docker login
   docker push yourusername/playwright-imagemagick:latest
   ```

4. **Using the Docker Image in CI/CD**

   Update your GitHub Actions workflow to use this Docker image for running tests and deployments:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     e2e:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       container:
         image: docker://yourusername/playwright-imagemagick:latest
         options: --platform linux/amd64 # Specify the platform
   ```

**Note**: If your system architecture differs, make sure to adjust the platform as needed to ensure compatibility.

# Test

## Unit/Integration tests & coverage

To launch the test runner, run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

If you wish to check the test coverage, run the following command:

```bash
yarn coverage
```

## E2E tests

To run the E2E tests, you must have a Tenderly API key to create and delete forks. You can set it in the `.env` file. Please refer to the [E2E readme](/e2e/README) for more information.

To ensure consistency and reliability in testing environments, we use Docker. Make sure the Docker image `doronbancor/playwright-imagemagick:latest` is specified in your CI/CD configuration.

# Build

Running the following, will build the app for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

It will build the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles the App in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Debug

The '/debug' route is available to debug the app (ex: localhost:3000/debug). It can be accessed by pressing the `Debug` main menu option which is shown when the app is ran locally. From the debug page you can access the following features:

- Set Imposter Account: Allows to set any account in the active network to impersonate.
- Set Tenderly RPC: Allows to set the RPC URL from a Tenderly fork, as well as setting custom addresses for the [carbonController contract](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/carbon-contracts/blob/dev/contracts/carbon/CarbonController.sol) and the [carbonVoucher contract](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/carbon-contracts/blob/dev/contracts/voucher/Voucher.sol). Leaving `Unchecked Signer` checked is recommended as it avoids the need to populate all details of the transaction before returning it, and avoids transaction errors when using the app.
- Tenderly Faucet: After setting the Tenderly RPC and Tenderly Account, the faucet can be used to add tokens to the impersonated wallet.
- Transfer Strategy NFT allows to transfer the NFT that represents the strategy with ID `Strategy ID` to the `Recipient` wallet. The active wallet must be the owner of the NFT to be able to transfer it.
- Notifications: allows to test `loading`, `success`, `failure` and `transaction` rejected notifications.
- Set E2E flag: allows to set the E2E flag to true or false - used when running e2e tests.
- Create Strategy: Allows to easily create multiple strategies - useful for debugging and used in E2E tests. A strategy template must follow the form:

```json
{
  "base": "ETH",
  "quote": "DAI",
  "buy": {
    "min": "1500",
    "max": "1700",
    "budget": "10"
  },
  "sell": {
    "min": "2000",
    "max": "2200",
    "budget": "1000"
  },
  "value": "10",
  "spread": "5"
}
```

where `spread` (fee tier in the UI) is in percentage, and `value` is the number of strategies to create.

# Network Configuration

## Change Network

1. Create a new folder under [`src/config`](src/config) with the name of the network (ex: "polygon")
2. Copy and paste the files from [`src/config/demo`](src/config/demo) into your folder
3. Update the `common.ts`, `production.ts` & `development.ts` files with your config, pointing to the CarbonDeFi contracts in that network, as well as setting the rpc.url and rpc.headers (rpc.url must match the one found in [Chain Lists](https://chainlist.org/)).
4. Update the [`src/config/index.ts`](src/config/index.ts) files to import your files
   `index.ts`

As an example on adding Polygon network:

```typescript
import ethereumDev from './ethereum/development';
import ethereumProd from './ethereum/production';
// Import polygon config
import polygonDev from './polygon/development';
import polygonProd from './polygon/production';

const configs = {
  ethereum: {
    development: ethereumDev,
    production: ethereumProd,
  },
  // add polygon here
  polygon: {
    development: polygonDev,
    production: polygonProd,
  },
};
```

5. Update the `.env` file to use the required network (ex: "polygon").

```bash
# Use polygon network
VITE_NETWORK=polygon
# Use any RPC URL to your network
VITE_CHAIN_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<API_KEY>
```

The app will use the rpc for the following purposes:

1. Add a network to the injected wallet.
2. Fetch data from the network.

If VITE_CHAIN_RPC_URL is not set, the app will use the rpc.url and rpc.headers from the development/production network configuration.

### Contracts with version < 5

In case the network is using a version of CarbonController older than 5 then there's no support for extended range for trade by source,
and it is recommended to set VITE_LEGACY_TRADE_BY_SOURCE_RANGE to true in .env to avoid possible reverts.

### Common configuration

The file `common.ts` with type [`AppConfig`](src/config/types.ts) contains important configuration for the app and network. It includes the following:

- `appUrl`: The URL of the app.
- `carbonApi`: The URL of the API.
- `selectedConnectors`: List of connectors to make available by default in the wallet selection modal that will be shown even if the connector is not injected. ex ['MetaMask', 'WalletConnect', 'Coinbase Wallet', 'Safe']
- `blockedConnectors`: List of EIP-6963 injected connectors names to block in the wallet selection modal.
- `walletConnectProjectId`: The WalletConnect project ID If you wish to add walletConnect, make sure to add it to `selectableConnectionTypes` as well.
- `network`
  - `name`: Network name.
  - `logoUrl`: Network logo URL.
  - `chainId`: Chain ID.
  - `defaultLimitedApproval`: Optional flag to set the default ERC-20 approval to limited approval. For chains where gas is low, it is recommended to set this flag to true.
  - `gasToken`: Gas token name, symbol, decimals, address and logoURI. This parameter will take priority over the `tokenListOverride`.
  - `blockExplorer`: The name and URL of the block explorer to be used in the notifications and when the network is added to the injected wallet.
  - `rpc`: 
    - `url`: RPC url of the network
    - `headers`: Headers append to each request to the RPC network
    - `batchSize`: The maximum number of JSON-RPC requests to send in a batch
    - `wait`: The maximum number of milliseconds to wait before sending a batch
- `defaultTokenPair`: Default token pair to be used in the app when opening the trade, explore, and simulation pages.
- `popularPairs`: List of popular pairs to be used in the app when opening the token selection modal.
- `popularTokens`: List of popular tokens to be used in the app when opening the token selection modal.
- `addresses`
  - `tokens`:
    - `ZERO`: Address of the zero token
  - `carbon`:
     - `carbonController`: Address of CarbonController contract
     - `voucher`: Address of Voucher contract 
  - `utils`: 
    - `multicall3`
      - `address`: Address of the multicall3 contract
      - `blockCreated`: Block of the creation of the multicall3
- `tokenListOverride`: Token list override to be used in the app when fetching the token list. Tokens in the list will override any other token with the same address.
- `tokenLists`: List of token lists including the uri and the parser name to be used to parse the token list. Please update the tokenParserMap in the `src/config/utils.ts` file to include the parser name and the parser function.
- `sdk`:
  - `cacheTTL`: When the app loads, it will ignore any cached data if it is older than the cacheTTL time in milliseconds. If set to 0, the app will always ignore the cache data and fetch new data on load.
  - `pairBatchSize`: Amount of pairs batched together in the same multicall when calling strategiesByPair
  - `blockRangeSize`: Max number of blocks to read logs from in a single call. Each time the SDK reads logs since last processed block it will split the total range into smaller ranges according to this configuration. This should be determined according to the RPC limitations.
  - `refreshInterval`: interval in millisecond between each cycle of reading latest events from the chain.
- `tenderly`
  - `faucetTokens`: List of address to get tokens from in the debug page
- `ui`
  - `showSimulator`: Flag to enable the simulation page.
  - `priceChart`: use `tradingView` chart or `native` chart for token pair price history. You need to provide a backend with price history endpoint to support `native` view.
  - `useGradientBranding`: Flag to enable gradient styles for buttons.
  - `tradeCount`: Display the amount of trades in the explorer page.
  - `currencyMenu`: Display the currency menu to switch between currencies.
  - `showTerms`: Display the terms page & links. ⚠️ If you set it to true, you need to change the content of the page ⚠️
  - `showPrivacy`: Display the privacy page & links. ⚠️ If you set it to true, you need to change the content of the page ⚠️
  - `showCart`: Allow to use the cart page to batch create strategies. You need to set the batcher contract address under `addresses.carbon.batcher`.
  - `walkthroughId`: If provided, it displays a walkthrough message when user arrives on the app for the first time. The id is the one provided by storylane.

#### Gas token different than native token

The CarbonDeFi Contracts, Backend and SDK use an internal fixed address for the native gas token, `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, hereby called `native token`. If a different `gas token` address than the `native token` address is set in `network.gasToken.address`, the app will hide the `gas token` from the token list and use the `network token` address for all token and pair searches.

### Add pairsToExchangeMapping

The file [`pairsToExchangeMapping.ts`](src/config/utils.ts) contains the mapping of pair symbols to exchange symbol to be used in the TradingView chart.

# Customization

## Change Logo

To change the logo in the app, you can replace the following files with your own:

- Logo file: [`carbon.svg`](src/assets/logos/carbon.svg).
- Banner file: [`carbon.jpg`](public/carbon.jpg) - used when sharing links to the app.
- Carbon Logo Loading: [`CarbonLogoLoading.tsx`](src/components/common/CarbonLogoLoading.tsx) - Used for loading animations in the app.
- Favicon file: [`favicon.ico`](public/favicon.ico).

Please do not replace the [`carbondefi.svg`](src/assets/logos/carbondefi.svg) file as it is used for the "Powered by CarbonDeFi" logo in the footer.

## Change Colors

The theme is defined in the [`tailwind.config.ts`](./tailwind.config.ts#L36) file.
You can update these colors:

- **background**: used for surfaces
- **primaryGradient**: used for the success variant button, with a first, middle and last gradient colors. Used when the config flag `useGradientBranding` is set to true
- **primary**: used for buttons and other actionable elements
- **secondary**: used as an alternative for primary & for gradient
- **success**: used for positive information like positive ROI
- **error**: used for error messages & buttons
- **warning**: used for warning messages (mainly in forms)
- **buy**: used for any information related to buy operation
- **sell**: used for any information related to sell operation

> **oklch**: colors are using oklch function to keep contrast no matter the color used. For browser support reason we decided to used the library `culari` to transform oklch into rgb instead of the native css method.

To get the oklch value of an hex color you can use this webapp: https://oklch.com

### Background

Background shades are calculated based on hue and chroma. In [`tailwind.config.ts`](./tailwind.config.ts#L37) you can specify `hue` and `chroma` of the background.

- `hue`: from 0 (pink) to 360 (pink).
- `chroma`: It's recommended to use 0.01 or 0.02 depending on the hue.

### Foreground

All other colors are defined with l,c,h values (see https://oklch.com), and the computed palettes will look like that:

```js
[color]: {
  light: lighten(value, 20%),
  DEFAULT: value,
  dark: darken(value, 50%),
}
```

You can change the % of the `lighten` & `darken` function with the [`lightDark`](./tailwind.config.ts#L20) function.

### Opt-in to gradient branding

To set the gradient branding in the app, the flag `useGradientBranding` in the network config must be set to true. The gradient branding colors are set in the `tailwind.config.ts` file under the `theme.colors.primaryGradient` key.

## Change font

The application uses two fonts :

- BW Gradual for the titles
- Euclid Circle A for the text

You can change the font by changing the files under :

- [`src/assets/font/title`](src/assets/font/title)
- [`src/assets/font/text`](src/assets/font/text)

Use the same naming as the current files.

### Change font weight & format

If you want to change the weight & format of the fonts you'll need to update the [`src/fonts.css`](src/fonts.css) file.

### Use only one font

If you want to use only one font, the easiest is to update [`tailwind.config.ts`](tailwind.config.ts#L83).
Under `theme.fontFamily` change the name of the font.

For example, if you want to only use Carbon Text:

```js
fontFamily: {
  text: ['Carbon-Text', 'sans-serif'],
  title: ['Carbon-Text', 'sans-serif'], // change to Carbon Text here
},
```

You can also remove the unused `@font-face` from the [`src/fonts.css`](src/fonts.css) file.
