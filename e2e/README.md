# E2E

## Local

Install Playwright browsers

```shell
yarn playwright install
```

E2E tests call the Tenderly API to create a fork of mainnet at a specific blockNumber. You need to have a [Tenderly account](https://tenderly.co/).

Add in your .env :

```bash
TENDERLY_ACCOUNT=bancor  # account or organisation
TENDERLY_PROJECT=carbon-test-forks
TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Install browsers and run in headless mode :

```shell
yarn e2e
```

Install browsers and run in UI mode :

```shell
yarn e2e --ui
```

## CI

E2E run in a github action on:

- Every commit
- When draft PR become ready for review
- When PRs are opened or re-opened
- If PR is against main

## Screenshots

Screenshots are taken during E2E and images are pushed automatically on the current PR branch.

Screenshots are only taken:

- In a Github Action
- If PR is not draft
- If PR is against main branch

<p style="border:solid 1px #303030; background-color: #30303030; border-radius:4px; padding:8px 16px">
Screenshots are not taken on draft PRs as the local branch would need to be merged on each change.

## Tips

### Wait for an element before asserting.

```typescript
// Wait for the modal with utils `waitFor`
await waitFor(page, 'modal');
await expect(page.getTestId('modal-title')).toHaveText('Confirm');

// Wait for a list using locator
const list = page.locator('[data-testid="strategy-list"] > li');
await list.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
await expect(list.toCount(1));
```

### TestId must be unique in the context. When testing a list, select the element first:

```typescript
const list = page.locator('[data-testid="strategy-list"] > li');
const [first] = await list.all();
await expect(first.getTestId('strategy-pair')).toHaveText('ETH/DAI');
```

### Using same network for all tests

As the same network was used for all tests, mutating a strategy in one test might impact another test. For now, it is suggested to try to use different token pairs for each test to avoid unwanted side effect, for example:

- `ETH/DAI`: Create recurring strategy
- `ETH/BNT`: Create overlapping strategy
- `ETH/USDC`: Trade Buy
- `USDC/USDT`: Trade Sell

### Mock data

If you need to mock data, you can use the [mock-api.mjs script](../scripts/mock-api.mjs). Please modify the script to return the desired data. If no data is available, the mocked routes will continue fetching.

### Mock date

If you need to mock the date, you can use the `mockDate` function. This function will mock the Date constructor and Date.now(). It must be be called before the page is navigated to.

```typescript
import { mockDate } from '../utils/mock-date';
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await mockDate(page, '2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z')
});
```

### Wait for network

When getting data from an external source, even if mocked, you may use `waitForResponse` to make sure the next test step is executed after the data is loaded.

```typescript
const historyPricesRegExp = /.*api\.carbondefi\.xyz\/v1\/history\/prices.*$/;
await this.page.waitForResponse(historyPricesRegExp);
```



## Common Errors

- **Error**: `Executable doesn't exist`
- **Solution**: run `yarn playwright install`
- **Description**: Browsers are not installed locally yet

---

- **Error**: `Page is closed`
- **Solution**: Increase timeout of test
- **Description**: This error happens if test is longer that the default timeout (120s). It can be appended at any stage of the test or the default timeout can be changed in the [playwright config file](.././playwright.config.ts).
- **Example**:

```typescript
test('Create strategy', ({ page }) => {
  test.setTimeout(60_000); // timeout of 60s for this test
  ...
})
```
